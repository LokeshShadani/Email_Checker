# Email Validation Script

This Python script checks the validity of an email address based on several criteria. The user is prompted to enter an email, and the script verifies if it meets the requirements for a valid email address.

## Script Overview

The script consists of the following components:

- **Input Prompt**: The user is prompted to input their email address.
- **Validation Checks**: The script performs several checks to determine the validity of the entered email address.

### Validation Criteria

1. **Length Check**: The email must be at least 6 characters long.
2. **Starting Character**: The email should start with an alphabetic character.
3. **"@" Symbol Check**: The email should contain exactly one "@" symbol.
4. **Domain and Extension Check**: The email should contain at least one dot (`.`) and should end with a valid domain extension (e.g., `.com`, `.org`, etc.).

### Output

The script provides feedback for each of the checks:
- It informs the user if the email is valid or not based on each criterion.
- If the email fails any of the checks, the script specifies the issue.

## How to Run

To run this script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Copy the script into a `.py` file.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `.py` file.
4. Run the script using the command:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
Enter your email when prompted.
Notes
The script currently checks for common patterns in email addresses but may not catch all invalid cases.
Further improvements can be made to handle edge cases and provide more comprehensive validation.
